Professional Journey
---
I am a passionate educator and technology enthusiast with over 21 years of dedicated service in engineering education. Throughout my career, I have worn multiple hats - from a committed teacher to a visionary technology leader, always driven by the mission to enhance educational experiences through innovative solutions.

My journey began with a strong foundation in computer science, earning my Bachelor's degree with First Class, followed by a Master of Engineering in Computer Science & Engineering with distinction (73.53%). Currently, I am pursuing my PhD at SRM University, focusing on "Predictions in MOOCs using AI," which perfectly aligns with my extensive experience in learning management systems and educational technology.

Philosophy & Mission
---
As a firm believer in the transformative power of technology in education, I have consistently advocated for the adoption of Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) solutions. My approach combines pedagogical excellence with technological innovation, ensuring that complex concepts are delivered effectively while leveraging cutting-edge tools to enhance learning outcomes.

My mission is to bridge the gap between traditional education and modern technology, creating learning environments that are not only academically rigorous but also technologically advanced, secure, and accessible to all students.
